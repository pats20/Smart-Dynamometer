# Smart-Dynamometer
Modeling and Characterization of RC-scale Smart Dynamometer for Electric Vehicle Testing

## Project Description
	Developed a model for dynamometer and motor and characterized the motor using a DC motor model<br/>
	Developed a speed measurement system using magnetic hall-effect sensor<br/>
	Designed a PID controller for drive cycle tracking using Arduino microcontroller<br/>
	Developed a dynamic state-space model for the combined EV-dyno system for the cross-validation of the experimental test bench<br/>
